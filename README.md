# ItemCollectables
ItemCollectables is a small plugin built for a handful of projects that needed to provide a quick and easy collectables system.

## Version: Minecraft Java 1.16+

> Sync a player's progress across multiple servers.

## Families
Collectables all belong to a parent family.
By defining your families you can then create collectables and add them to those families.
Once collectables are found in-game, players can look at their progress on specific families using the `/bag <family name>` command.

## Collectables
Collectables are individual items that will spawn in the world for players to find.
Once collectables are found, they can be viewed using the `/bag` command.
